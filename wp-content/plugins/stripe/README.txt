The easiest way to add a high conversion Stripe Checkout form to your site and start getting paid.

== Description ==

Add a highly optimized Stripe Checkout form overlay to your site in a few simple steps.

Instead of spending time building your own checkout forms you can use Stripe's, which is continually tested for high conversion.

> "Stripe Checkout is an embeddable payment form for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It works within your site—customers can pay instantly, without being redirected away to complete the transaction."

This is a simple standalone Stripe checkout plugin. That's it. **No other plugins required.**

**SSL Note:** Stripe does require that pages hosting the checkout form be SSL (they should start with `https://`). [Read more about SSL](https://stripe.com/help/ssl)

###Start Accepting Payments in 3 Easy Steps###

It only takes a couple minutes to add a payment form to your site.

1. Activate the plugin, go to Settings > Simple Stripe Checkout, then enter your Stripe keys.
1. Edit the post or page where you want the payment button and checkout form to appear.
1. Add a simple shortcode.

Viola! Now a payment button that opens your checkout form in an overlay will pop up.
